"""Open/closed boundary guard (Faz A, NLnet plan v2 — gate A).

The open core must build and test without any closed-repository code:

1. no module of the closed ecosystem (EvidenceOS and friends) may appear as
   an import target anywhere in this repository's Python sources, and
2. BOUNDARY.md must stay present so the classification cannot silently
   disappear.

The closed side consumes this package only as a pinned PyPI distribution;
vendoring checks live in the closed repository's CI, not here.
